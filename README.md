Look into https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/BCI-O and speak to Madhwa.
I’d be interested in developing a ‘thin’ client which emits quad streams from the device rather than raw sensor data.

These quad streams can then be used by various applications.

Emitted should also conform to a set of defined SHACL/SHEX constraints so they can be ingested into other applications in a *type safe* manner.

Since there are multiple wearables involved in the experiment I would be interested in it would be good to produce/use a general ontology (probably something that extends the SSN onotology) that all of the wearables can interface with.
